# test-repo Constitution

## Purpose & Scope

This constitution states the engineering principles and code conventions that govern this repository, a typed Python
project whose importable code lives in the `src/test_repo` package. The body is repo-agnostic
engineering, so it can be reused across projects. The Project Profile at the end instantiates it for this repository,
naming the concrete framework contract, toolchain, dependencies, and delivery surfaces. A project extends the
constitution by growing its Project Profile, and by amending the body when a new rule is genuinely general.

This file is seeded from a template. Refine it as the project develops. The `.specify/` templates and agent commands are
added by running `specify init` alongside this file.

Rules use MUST and MUST NOT for what the gate and review enforce. They use plain statements for the taste an automated
gate cannot check. Both are binding.

## Writing Style

This constitution, the prose documents, the docstrings, and the examples follow one style. Write for a reader who wants
to understand, not to be impressed.

- Write clear sentences of a natural length. Do not chop the prose into short choppy sentences, and do not pad it into
  long winding ones. Let the length vary the way it does when a person writes well, and let sentences join with commas
  and conjunctions where that reads better.
- Say who does what in the normal order, subject then verb then object. Write "the job writes the features table", not
  "a features table is written by the job".
- Do not invert word order for effect. Do not use the passive voice unless the doer is unknown or does not matter.
- Use plain words. Do not use idioms, metaphors, or literary flourish. It reads as a person wrote it for another
  person, not as a performance.
- State a real risk once, in the right place, plainly. Do not hedge, and do not repeat a warning.
- Give a document headings and subsections so a reader can scan it. Do not write a page as one undivided block.
- A line is at most 120 characters. A sentence uses no semicolon and no dash as punctuation. Hyphenated words such as
  trailing-underscore are fine.

## Core Principles

### I. Honor the Ecosystem Contract

Public objects MUST conform to the contract of the framework they plug into, rather than inventing a parallel
convention that silently breaks downstream code. Constructor parameters are stored unmodified under their own names.
State learned at runtime is exposed only through the framework's convention for derived state. Behavior is configured
through explicit parameters, never through hidden global or ambient state, so an object is deterministic and testable in
isolation. The concrete contract this project conforms to is named in its Project Profile.

Rationale: interoperability with an established ecosystem is a project's core value. Drift from its contract breaks
users' code in ways the tests here cannot see.

### II. Type Safety & Boundary Validation

All code, public and internal, MUST carry complete type annotations and pass the static type checker with no new ignored
errors. Data that crosses a public boundary MUST be validated against an explicit, declared schema. Data-shape
assumptions MUST be declared as schemas, not enforced by ad-hoc runtime checks scattered through the code.

Rationale: a typed project that operates on structured data has contracts that are easy to break silently. Static types
and boundary schemas catch integration errors before they reach users.

### III. Tests Accompany Behavior

Every behavioral change MUST ship with tests, and a bug fix MUST include a regression test that fails before the fix.
The suite runs with branch coverage and randomized ordering, so a test MUST NOT depend on the order it runs in. New
logic MUST NOT reduce the coverage of the module it touches. Tests run locally with no account or external service
required.
Where the documentation and docstrings carry runnable examples, the build proves them, so every example MUST run.
Rationale: a behavior with no test is a claim no one can check, and randomized ordering guards against order-dependent
flakiness.

### IV. Automated Quality Gates (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Code MUST pass the full automated gate before merge: formatting, linting, static type checking, docstring coverage and
docstring correctness, a security scan, and a dependency audit. In this project the gate is `ruff`, `mypy`, `bandit`,
`pip-audit`, `deptry`, `pydoclint`, and `interrogate`, run through the `checks` task locally and again in CI. A red run
blocks merge. The hooks are not bypassed. Failures MUST be fixed at the source. Disabling a rule is the exception
governed by Comments & Suppressions, not a workaround.

Rationale: one machine-enforced bar removes style debate, keeps diffs reviewable, and stops security-sensitive
dependencies from silently degrading.

### V. Documentation as a First-Class Artifact

Every public module, class, and function MUST have a docstring in the project's chosen style. A user-facing behavioral
change MUST update the affected documentation, and MUST add or amend a changelog entry when it changes public behavior.
Every code example in the documentation and the docstrings MUST run, and the build proves it. No example is a fragment,
pseudo-code, or a demo that cannot run. No example depends on a secret or the network. An example uses sample data, a
placeholder, or a fake, or it is removed. A capability that cannot run offline is shown as reference code in the guide,
not as a runnable example, so no example pretends to run.

Rationale: a project is adopted through its documentation. An undocumented capability does not exist for users, and it
rots without executable coverage.

### VI. Separate Pure Logic from Application Concerns

The `src/test_repo` package stays logic that is deterministic and testable in isolation.
Application concerns are the caller's, not the package's: an orchestrator, a long-lived session, environment
configuration, a schedule, a credential, or external IO. A capability that needs a credential or performs a real-world
side effect MUST live behind an optional extra or a deployed entry point, never in the default install and never in the
pure logic.

Rationale: logic free of application state stays composable and testable, and the boundary is what lets the tests run
with nothing provisioned.

## Code Conventions

These are binding, not advisory. They are generic Python and hold in any project. The automated gate checks the
mechanical parts. These conventions are the taste it cannot check.

### Naming

A function name begins with a verb and names what the function actually does or returns. Write `count_common_prefix`,
not `common_prefix_length`. Write `normalize_identity`, not `transform_identity`. Write `build_roster`, not `roster`. A
name that begins with a noun describes a value, and a function is not a value. The verb is honest: a function that loads
or resolves an object from a reference is `load_` or `resolve_`, not `build_`. Avoid empty verbs that say nothing, such
as `process`, `handle`, `manage`, or `transform` with no object.

A method is an action and begins with a verb. A property names a value and is a noun phrase, never verb-first. State an
instance derives at runtime carries the framework's derived-state marker where the ecosystem defines one, such as a
trailing underscore. This holds whether the state is a stored attribute or a computed property. A public instance name
is therefore one of two things. It is a constructor parameter, stored unmodified under its own name with no marker. Or
it is a derivation, carrying the marker. Anything else an instance exposes is private. A class-level constant that
declares what a class is, such as its kind or its name, is a `ClassVar` and stands apart from this.

A module is named for the concern it owns. Use a descriptive noun for what it does or holds, such as `_resolver`,
`_schedule`, or `_factory`. Do not name it for the data it consumes, and do not name it for the surface that happens to
call it. It MUST NOT reuse a name that collides with a dependency's concept. Names come from the domain, used
consistently.

A constant is named for what it holds, not for a role it happens to play. Read every constant name and check it still
describes its value.

### Module Structure

A module reads top to bottom in one order. First a one-line imperative module docstring, then the imports grouped
standard library, third party, first party. The linter sorts the imports, so do not sort them by hand. A module imports
the package's own code with a relative import: a sibling is `from ._name import`, and a name from another subpackage is
`from ..package import`. The absolute `from test_repo...` form is only for code outside the
package, such as the tests, and for entry-point modules that a runner launches as top-level scripts with no parent
package, where a relative import would raise `ImportError` once the script runs. This is a hard rule with no other
exceptions: no module under `src/test_repo` imports the package's own code, a sibling, a name
from another subpackage, or a shared leaf, through an absolute `from test_repo...` path. Every
such import is relative, the depth counted from the importing module's own package. A module adds `from __future__
import annotations` above the imports only when it needs it, for a forward reference or a name that exists only under
`TYPE_CHECKING`. The supported language floor decides, and a version that resolves the annotations without it does not
carry it. Then module constants and type aliases. Then functions in dependency order, so a name is defined before it is
used, the small helpers first and the function the module exists for last.

A module constant is `UPPER_CASE`, and it lives in the constants block near the top of the module, never mid-file among
the functions. Consecutive constants form one block with no blank line between them. A blank line separates the
constants block from the imports above and the code below, never one constant from the next. A constant is public and
carries no leading underscore. The privacy underscore marks functions, classes, and modules, not constants, so a value
the module defines is named plainly whether or not other modules read it.

One module is one concern. When a file grows two, split it. Small general helpers may share a `_utils` module, whose one
concern is the assorted helpers a package needs, and a helper earns its own module only when it takes on a distinct role
worth a name, as `_base` or `_types` do, not for every function. A definition lives in the module that owns it. A base
module is self-contained and imports no sibling. Its purpose is to be imported, not to import, so a base that needs a
sibling's code absorbs it by merging rather than importing. A type-only alias under `TYPE_CHECKING` is not a sibling.

### Package Layering

The top level of a package holds subpackages and its `__init__`, not loose implementation modules. The shared leaves the
whole tree imports, the type vocabulary, the shared constants, and the shared building primitives, live in a shared
subpackage, and the rest of the tree imports them from there. A builder lives in the package that owns what it builds,
and is re-exported from there. This keeps every import running downward, from the shared leaves to domain packages to
surfaces, so no cycle can form. No import inside a function body papers over a cycle. Fix the cycle. The only lazy
import defers an optional dependency and carries a suppression with a reason. Prefer this layering over a suppression
and a comment that paper over an out-of-order import.

### Public Surface

Only packages are public; every module is private, named `_name`. The unit of public API is the package, and its
`__init__` is the only surface. There are no public modules anywhere in the tree. A concern that would otherwise be a
public module becomes a package instead: a directory whose `__init__` re-exports its private `_<concern>` implementation
module, so the import path a client uses stays `package.concern` while the code lives in `package/concern/_concern.py`.
Implementation modules, classes, and helpers are private, named `_name`. The package `__init__` re-exports the public
surface with an explicit `__all__`, and carries only its docstring and those re-exports, with no logic of its own. A
public name used outside the module that defines it is re-exported through its owning package's `__init__` and imported
from that surface, never from the private module that defines it. It is re-exported once, where it lives, and a parent
package does not re-export a subpackage's surface a second time. This holds for all code, production and tests alike.
Reaching into another package's private module for a public name is the smell the re-export removes.

Entry-point modules that a runner launches as top-level scripts are client code, not library internals, even though they
sit inside the package tree. So an entry point imports every name it uses from a package surface, never from a sibling
private `_module`. If a private module holds a name the entry point needs, re-export that name through the package
`__init__` first. Tests are client code by the same rule, with one narrow exception: a module's own dedicated unit test
may import that module's private helpers and monkeypatch its internal seams directly, because it is exercising the
unit's internals rather than consuming it as a client. A test never reaches into a different module's privates, and
public names always come from the surface.

An `__init__` holds only its docstring and the re-exports. It carries no logic, no function, and no `__getattr__`. A
name that has to be computed to be exposed lives in a module, not the `__init__`.

### Docstrings

The summary line is one line, imperative, and says what the thing does. It is never `Implements the ...`, `This function
...`, or `A class that ...`, which are meta narration. Write it in plain English. Prefer simple, direct words over
clever or roundabout phrasing, and if a line reads awkwardly out loud, rewrite it.

The leading underscore is the only privacy signal, and it decides the docstring. A private name, a function, method, or
class whose name starts with an underscore, carries only its one-line summary, and never more. Every public name, one
that does not start with an underscore, carries the full docstring: the summary line, an `Args` block documenting every
parameter, a `Returns` block for what it returns, and a `Raises` block where it raises. This holds for a public function
wherever it lives, including inside a private module, so a helper that does not earn a full docstring is named with a
leading underscore instead. A `property`, and a public function that takes no parameter and returns nothing, keeps just
the summary line. A constructor parameter and a dataclass field are documented under `Args`. An `Attributes` block is
only for learned state.

A docstring describes what the thing is and what it holds, plainly. It does not state its virtues. It does not give the
rationale for its shape, the `since ...` or `so ...` clause. It does not say what downstream code builds from it. State
the content, not the sales pitch, the justification, or the uses. Never describe what the code does not do. Never
restate a self-evident name. No essays, and no editorializing. A docstring joins no two clauses with a semicolon or a
dash. Each point is its own sentence.

### Comments & Suppressions

No explanatory comments. The names say what, the docstring says why the thing exists. An inline comment that explains a
line, states the rationale for an implementation choice, or points out a caveat means the line or its names are unclear,
so fix those instead. A caveat or rationale that genuinely matters, a known divergence from a source, a correctness
invariant, or a safety constraint, is written into the project documentation under `docs/`, not the source. Lesser notes
live in the commit message or an issue. The only comments in source are a `# noqa` or `# type: ignore` suppression.
Delete every other comment when found, and never add one.

A comment never narrates the development process. It does not describe a migration, a transitional or temporary state,
what a thing used to be, or what will change later. The code describes what is, not its history or its plan, and that
kind of note belongs in a commit message or an issue, not the source. A comment is also never a decorative separator or
a section banner, a line of dashes or a titled divider. Delete such comments when found.

A lint or type suppression, a `# noqa` or a `# type: ignore`, is a last resort for a genuine one-off, and it carries the
rule code and the reason. When the same suppression recurs across the repository, it is not repeated inline. The rule is
configured once in `pyproject.toml`, as a scoped ignore, so the decision lives in one place rather than scattered
through the source.

### Errors

Build the message in a variable, then raise it. Raise a specific named exception defined for the module or package, not
a bare `Exception` or `ValueError` where a named one carries meaning. The message tells the reader what to do, the
variable that was missing, or the value that did not match. Do not catch and swallow. Catch narrowly, or let it
propagate.

### Control Flow

Functions are small and do one thing. A function that needs a paragraph of docstring body to explain its branches is two
functions. Return early with guard clauses. Avoid deep nesting, and extract a helper before the third level of
indentation.

### Don't Repeat Yourself

A fact, a definition, or a derivation lives in exactly one place. When the same thing is expressed twice, collapse it
to one. Do not store what can be derived from what you already keep. Persist the source and derive the projection on
demand, not both. Do not reimplement a capability the codebase already has. Reuse it rather than writing a second copy
in another module.

A constant that two modules define the same way is one fact, whatever each names it. Lift it to the subpackage that
holds the shared leaves and import it from there. Two constants that share a value but not a meaning are two facts and
stay apart. The same holds for behavior. Collapse only the fragment that is identical at every call site. When call
sites differ in what they check or emit, a helper that unifies them changes behavior, so leave them apart.

### Tests

The test tree mirrors the source tree. A test is named `test_<function>_<behavior>`. It begins with the function it
exercises, then a terse behavior phrase with articles dropped, and its docstring is a single line. A test never imports
a private name from a private module. It uses the public API the way a user does, and if it needs an internal, the
internal wants to be public. No test reaches the network or an external service. Use a recorded payload or a fake.
Fixtures are typed, small, and live in the nearest `conftest.py`.

### Credentials

A credential is named, never passed. A function, command flag, or tool argument takes the name of the variable holding
the secret, and reads it where it is used. A secret never becomes an argument value, a log line, or a pickle.

## Development Workflow

Development tasks are [nox](https://nox.thea.codes) sessions, invoked through the package manager. Run these, do not
reach for the underlying tools directly.

- `pdm formatting` formats the code and docstrings. `pdm formatting code` and `pdm formatting docstrings` format one at a time.
- `pdm checks` runs the whole quality gate. `pdm checks quality`, `pdm checks types`, `pdm checks security`, `pdm checks
  dependencies`, and `pdm checks docs` run one part at a time.
- `pdm tests` runs the test suite with coverage.
- `pdm docs` serves the documentation locally, and
  `pdm docs build` builds it.
- `pdm changelog` builds the changelog.
- `pdm release` cuts a release.

The steps of a change are: branch, write the code and its tests, run `pdm formatting`, then `pdm checks`,
then `pdm tests`, and serve the docs if the change touched them. Work happens on feature branches. The main branch
stays green. Pre-commit runs the gate on every commit, and the hooks are not bypassed. Before opening a pull request,
run the full gate and resolve every finding. CI re-runs the same gates, and a red run blocks merge.

## Toolchain & Standards

- Language: the project supports >=3.11, <3.14 and MUST remain compatible across all of them.
- Dependencies: a new runtime dependency MUST be justified and declared in `pyproject.toml`, not vendored ad hoc. A
  credentialled or side-effecting capability lives behind an optional extra, per Principle VI. The lock file is
  committed.
- Build and packaging: a `src`-based layout with SCM-derived versioning. Generated version metadata is not hand-edited.
- Style: line length 120 and Google docstrings, set once in `pyproject.toml` and never overridden by hand.
- Commits and releases: commit messages follow the conventional, angular style, one of `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`,
  `refactor`, `tests`, `chore`. Releases follow semantic versioning and update the changelog before tagging.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes ad-hoc conventions and prior undocumented practice. It applies to all code, documentation,
and tooling changes in the repository.

- Amendments: proposed through a pull request that edits this file, states the rationale, and updates the version, then
  propagates the change to the dependent Spec Kit templates.
- Versioning policy: semantic versioning of the constitution itself. MAJOR is a backward-incompatible removal or
  redefinition of a principle or governance rule, or a structural rewrite. MINOR is a new principle or section, or
  materially expanded guidance. PATCH is a clarification or a non-semantic wording fix.
- Compliance review: every pull request and code review MUST verify adherence to the Core Principles and the Code
  Conventions. A deviation MUST be justified in the pull request. Unjustified violations block merge.

## Project Profile: test-repo

This section instantiates the body above for this repository. It is the repo-specific part, and it is a starting point
to fill in as the project takes shape.

- Ecosystem contract, Principle I: TODO name the framework contract this project conforms to (for example, an estimator
  or plugin contract, a web framework's application contract, or none if the project defines its own).
- Language: Python >=3.11, <3.14.
- Build and tooling: PDM with SCM-derived versioning and a `src`
  layout. The `nox` sessions are `formatting`, `checks`, `tests`, `docs`, `changelog`, and `release`. The gate covers
  `ruff`, `mypy`, `bandit`, `pip-audit`, `deptry`, `pydoclint`, and `interrogate`, with `pytest` under branch coverage
  and randomized ordering.
- Layout: library. The importable package under `src/test_repo` is distributed to others.
