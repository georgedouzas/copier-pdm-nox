Sync Impact Report
==================
Version change: 1.2.0 → 2.0.0 → 2.0.1
Bump rationale for 2.0.0: MAJOR, a structural rewrite. The shared engineering body seeded into
generated projects is adopted here too: Purpose & Scope, Writing Style, the full Code Conventions
the repository defines and propagates, a Development Workflow, and a Project Profile. The six
template principles are unchanged in meaning; their prose was rewritten to follow the new Writing
Style, which forbids the em-dash and semicolon as sentence punctuation.
Bump rationale for 2.0.1: PATCH. The 2.0.0 adoption had quietly softened two Code Conventions
against the source it claimed to adopt. The strict wording is restored: constants form one block
with no blank line between them, and there are no explanatory comments in source, only a `# noqa`
or `# type: ignore` suppression, with genuinely important caveats written into the documentation.

Modified principles: none in substance. Principles I-VI keep their meaning, reworded for style.

Added sections:
  - Purpose & Scope
  - Writing Style
  - Code Conventions
  - Project Profile: copier-modern-python

Removed sections: none

# Copier Modern Python Constitution

## Purpose & Scope

This constitution states the engineering principles and conventions that govern this repository, a
Copier template that generates modern Python projects. The body has two parts. The Writing Style and
the Code Conventions are repo-agnostic and hold for any Python project. The Core Principles, the
Template Contract, and the Project Profile are specific to a template whose product is the projects it
generates, not a library of its own.

Rules use MUST and MUST NOT for what the tests and review enforce. They use plain statements for the
taste an automated check cannot see. Both are binding.

## Writing Style

This constitution, the prose documents, the commit messages, and the docstrings in the repository's
scripts follow one style. Write for a reader who wants to understand, not to be impressed.

- Write clear sentences of a natural length. Do not chop the prose into short choppy sentences, and do
  not pad it into long winding ones. Let sentences join with commas and conjunctions where that reads
  better.
- Say who does what in the normal order, subject then verb then object. Write "the script renders each
  fixture", not "each fixture is rendered by the script".
- Do not invert word order for effect. Do not use the passive voice unless the doer is unknown or does
  not matter.
- Use plain words. Do not use idioms, metaphors, or literary flourish. It reads as a person wrote it
  for another person, not as a performance.
- State a real risk once, in the right place, plainly. Do not hedge, and do not repeat a warning.
- Give a document headings and subsections so a reader can scan it.
- A line is at most 120 characters. A sentence uses no semicolon and no dash as punctuation. Hyphenated
  words such as trailing-underscore are fine.

## Core Principles

### I. The Generated Project Is the Product

A change is judged by the project it produces, never by the template source alone. Every generated
project MUST install, pass its own quality checks, and pass its own test suite immediately after
generation, with no manual repair step. A template edit that renders valid Jinja but yields a project
whose own `checks` or `tests` session fails is a broken change.

Rationale: users never read the `.jinja` files. They run `copier copy` and then run the project.
Rendering successfully is not the same as working, and the gap between the two is where this
repository's defects have historically lived.

### II. Matrix Parity (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

The template offers a matrix of choices: four git providers (GitHub, GitLab, Azure DevOps, Bitbucket),
two package managers (PDM, uv), and project layout. Any behavioural change to one branch of that matrix
MUST be applied to, or explicitly and visibly declined for, every other branch in the same change.

When a capability cannot be expressed identically across a dimension, the change MUST state which values
it covers and why the others differ. Silent divergence is prohibited. A fix that lands only on the
GitHub path leaves the other three quietly broken, and nothing in the test suite will say so.

Layout is a first-class dimension of this matrix, not a variant of the library case. Every layout MUST
receive the same quality floor: the same nox sessions, the same checks, the same release topology,
adapted where the layout genuinely demands it and identical otherwise.

Rationale: the matrix is the reason the template exists. Options that rot are worse than options never
offered, because a user selected them expecting parity.

### III. Fixtures Are the Specification

`tests/expected/` holds the full rendered output for every supported answer combination, and
`bats tests/test_copier.bats` diffs generated output against it. Every change that alters rendered
output MUST regenerate those fixtures in the same commit.

Fixtures MUST be regenerated by rendering the template, never hand-edited to match an expectation. Each
commit MUST leave the fixture suite green, so that the history bisects.

The golden fixtures MUST cover the full cross product of the structural dimensions, project layout, git
provider and package manager, because the packaging and pipeline templates branch on all three and
their interactions are where rendering defects hide. Orthogonal dimensions that do not interact with
those, publish and license, are covered by a representative fixture each rather than crossed. A single
script MUST be the source of truth for the set, and the golden test MUST read that same set back rather
than restate it, so the two cannot diverge. Every layout MUST additionally be generated and executed by
the integration suite. The golden suite proves a combination renders, the integration suite proves it
works.

Rationale: the fixtures are the only artifact that makes a Jinja whitespace change or a conditional's
blast radius legible in review. The diff against them is the change, and the bug that shipped in one
provider's pipeline for one package manager is only legible if that pair has a fixture.

### IV. Verify by Execution, Not by Inspection

Reading a rendered file is not verification. Claims about generated projects MUST be established by
running the thing.

- YAML that a CI service consumes MUST be parsed and its structure inspected, not eyeballed. Jinja
  whitespace control silently relocates keys.
- A claim that a tool honours configuration MUST be demonstrated both with and without that
  configuration, so the difference is observed rather than assumed.
- A claim that a defect is pre-existing MUST be confirmed against an unmodified checkout before it is
  attributed.

Rationale: the failures this template has shipped were invisible to inspection and obvious to execution.

### V. Honest, Conventional History

Commits MUST follow the Angular convention enforced by `conventional-pre-commit`, using only the types
`feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `tests`, `chore`.

A commit body MUST explain what was broken and why the change is correct, not merely restate the diff.
Work that fixes a defect beyond the requested scope MUST be committed separately from the requested
work, so either can be reviewed, reverted, or cherry-picked on its own.

Rationale: `git-changelog` derives releases and version bumps from this history, so commit types are
load-bearing rather than decorative.

### VI. Current Tooling, Deliberately Chosen

The template's value is that it wires up the current generation of Python tooling so a user does not
have to. Keeping that current is an obligation, not a nicety. A tool that has been superseded or
abandoned MUST be replaced rather than carried, and the template MUST NOT generate projects onto dead
dependencies.

Adopting or replacing a tool MUST meet three conditions.

- The tool earns its place against what it replaces, and the commit body says how.
- It is integrated, not merely installed: configured in `pyproject.toml`, invoked by a nox session, and
  exercised by CI, so it actually runs.
- It is verified by execution on a generated project under Principle IV, across every affected branch of
  the matrix under Principle II.

Breadth is not the goal. A tool that no session runs is dead weight that every generated project pays
for, and each addition is weighed against the cost it imposes on every project the template will ever
create.

Rationale: users adopt this template to inherit good defaults they did not have to research. Defaults
decay silently, and a template that stops tracking the ecosystem becomes a way to start new projects
already behind.

## Code Conventions

These are the Python conventions this repository defines. They govern the repository's own Python, the
scripts under `scripts/`, and they are the conventions the template seeds into every generated project,
so they are stated here in full. Some subsections describe package structure that the two scripts do not
exercise, and they still bind the generated projects that do. They are generic Python and the taste an
automated check cannot see.

### Naming

A function name begins with a verb and names what the function actually does or returns. Write
`count_common_prefix`, not `common_prefix_length`. Write `normalize_identity`, not `transform_identity`.
Write `build_roster`, not `roster`. A name that begins with a noun describes a value, and a function is
not a value. The verb is honest: a function that loads or resolves an object from a reference is `load_`
or `resolve_`, not `build_`. Avoid empty verbs that say nothing, such as `process`, `handle`, `manage`,
or `transform` with no object.

A method is an action and begins with a verb. A property names a value and is a noun phrase, never
verb-first. State an instance derives at runtime carries the framework's derived-state marker where the
ecosystem defines one, such as a trailing underscore. A public instance name is therefore one of two
things. It is a constructor parameter, stored unmodified under its own name with no marker. Or it is a
derivation, carrying the marker. Anything else an instance exposes is private.

A module is named for the concern it owns. Use a descriptive noun for what it does or holds. Do not name
it for the data it consumes, and do not name it for the surface that happens to call it. A constant is
named for what it holds, not for a role it happens to play.

### Module Structure

A module reads top to bottom in one order. First a one-line imperative module docstring, then the imports
grouped standard library, third party, first party. The linter sorts the imports, so do not sort them by
hand. A module imports the package's own code with a relative import: a sibling is `from ._name import`,
and a name from another subpackage is `from ..package import`. The absolute form is only for code outside
the package, such as the tests, and for entry-point modules that a runner launches as top-level scripts
with no parent package. A module adds `from __future__ import annotations` above the imports only when it
needs it, for a forward reference or a name that exists only under `TYPE_CHECKING`. Then module constants
and type aliases. Then functions in dependency order, so a name is defined before it is used, the small
helpers first and the function the module exists for last.

A module constant is `UPPER_CASE`, and it lives in the constants block near the top of the module, never
mid-file among the functions. Consecutive constants form one block with no blank line between them. A
blank line separates the constants block from the imports above and the code below, never one constant
from the next. One module is one concern. When a file grows two, split it. Small general helpers may
share a `_utils` module, and a helper earns its own module only when it takes on a distinct role worth a
name.

### Package Layering

The top level of a package holds subpackages and its `__init__`, not loose implementation modules. The
shared leaves the whole tree imports, the type vocabulary, the shared constants, and the shared building
primitives, live in a shared subpackage, and the rest of the tree imports them from there. This keeps
every import running downward, from the shared leaves to domain packages to surfaces, so no cycle can
form. No import inside a function body papers over a cycle. Fix the cycle. The only lazy import defers an
optional dependency and carries a suppression with a reason.

### Public Surface

Only packages are public; every module is private, named `_name`. The unit of public API is the package,
and its `__init__` is the only surface. A concern that would otherwise be a public module becomes a
package instead: a directory whose `__init__` re-exports its private `_<concern>` implementation module,
so the import path a client uses stays `package.concern` while the code lives in
`package/concern/_concern.py`. The package `__init__` re-exports the public surface with an explicit
`__all__`, and carries only its docstring and those re-exports, with no logic of its own. A public name
used outside the module that defines it is re-exported through its owning package's `__init__` and
imported from that surface, never from the private module that defines it. Reaching into another
package's private module for a public name is the smell the re-export removes. This holds for production
and tests alike, with one narrow exception: a module's own dedicated unit test may import that module's
private helpers to exercise its internals.

### Docstrings

The summary line is one line, imperative, and says what the thing does. It is never `Implements the ...`,
`This function ...`, or `A class that ...`, which are meta narration. Write it in plain English.

The leading underscore is the only privacy signal, and it decides the docstring. A private name carries
only its one-line summary, and never more. Every public name carries the full docstring: the summary
line, an `Args` block documenting every parameter, a `Returns` block for what it returns, and a `Raises`
block where it raises. A `property`, and a public function that takes no parameter and returns nothing,
keeps just the summary line.

A docstring describes what the thing is and what it holds, plainly. It does not state its virtues, give
the rationale for its shape, or say what downstream code builds from it. Never describe what the code
does not do. Never restate a self-evident name. Each point is its own sentence.

### Comments & Suppressions

No explanatory comments. The names say what, the docstring says why the thing exists. An inline comment
that explains a line, states the rationale for an implementation choice, or points out a caveat means the
line or its names are unclear, so fix those instead. A caveat or rationale that genuinely matters, a
correctness invariant, or a safety constraint, is written into the project documentation, not the source.
Lesser notes live in the commit message or an issue. The only comments in source are a `# noqa` or a
`# type: ignore` suppression. Delete every other comment when found, and never add one.

A comment never narrates the development process. It does not describe a migration, a transitional or
temporary state, what a thing used to be, or what will change later. A comment is also never a decorative
separator or a section banner. Delete such comments when found.

A lint or type suppression carries the rule code and the reason. When the same suppression recurs across
the repository, it is not repeated inline. The rule is configured once in `pyproject.toml`, as a scoped
ignore, so the decision lives in one place rather than scattered through the source.

### Errors

Build the message in a variable, then raise it. Raise a specific named exception defined for the module
or package, not a bare `Exception` or `ValueError` where a named one carries meaning, or report it with a
clear `sys.exit` string. The message tells the reader what to do, the variable that was missing, or the
value that did not match. Do not catch and swallow. Catch narrowly, or let it propagate.

### Control Flow

Functions are small and do one thing. A function that needs a paragraph of docstring body to explain its
branches is two functions. Return early with guard clauses. Avoid deep nesting, and extract a helper
before the third level of indentation.

### Don't Repeat Yourself

A fact, a definition, or a derivation lives in exactly one place. This is why `scripts/regen_fixtures.py`
is the single source of truth for the fixture set and the golden test reads that set back rather than
restating it, per Principle III. Do not store what can be derived from what you already keep, and do not
reimplement a capability the repository already has.

### Tests

The test tree mirrors the source tree. A test uses the public API the way a user does, and if it needs an
internal, the internal wants to be public. No test reaches the network or an external service. Use a
recorded payload or a fake. Fixtures are typed, small, and live in the nearest `conftest.py`. In this
repository the golden and integration suites are `bats`, and they render real projects and run their
toolchains rather than mock them.

### Credentials

A credential is named, never passed. A function, command flag, or tool argument takes the name of the
variable holding the secret, and reads it where it is used. A secret never becomes an argument value, a
log line, or a pickle.

## Template Contract

These constraints hold for every generated project regardless of the answers given.

- **Project layouts**: the template generates a project of a chosen layout, one of library, script,
  machine learning, data engineering, or service. A layout defines the source tree, the dependency set,
  the documentation shape, and which nox sessions apply. It MUST NOT be a fork of the template's spine.
  Layouts vary in what they generate, never in whether the quality floor of Principle II applies to them.
- **Task interface**: development tasks are nox sessions (`clean`, `docs`, `formatting`, `checks`,
  `tests`, `changelog`, `release`), surfaced through the package manager's script table. New capability
  SHOULD be added as a session rather than a new entry point.
- **Release topology**: the `release` session is the local kickoff that writes the changelog, opens and
  merges the release pull request, and pushes the tag. The pipeline is the sole publisher. Exactly one
  publisher MUST exist for a given version. When `git_provider` is `None` and no pipeline exists, the
  session publishes instead.
- **Publishing gate**: a pipeline MUST NOT publish a tag whose test and quality stages have not passed.
- **Non-interactive automation**: any command invoked by a session or a pipeline MUST NOT block on a
  prompt.
- **Least privilege**: CI workflows MUST declare the narrowest permissions they need.
- **Configuration lives in `pyproject.toml`**: tools MUST be invoked so that they read it, so a
  generated project can record its own suppressions.
- **Committed lock file**: the generated project commits its package manager's lock file for
  reproducible installs.

## Development Workflow

The tasks are `make` targets, and the fixtures are the axis every change turns on.

- `make regen-fixtures` renders every covered answer combination into `tests/expected/`. It is the only
  supported way to update the fixtures. Never hand-edit a fixture to match an expectation.
- `make tests` runs the golden suite, which diffs a fresh render of every fixture against the committed
  output, and then `scripts/check_pipelines.py`, which parses every generated pipeline rather than
  reading it. It MUST pass before any commit.
- `make tests-integration` generates real projects and runs their toolchains, including a container
  build where Docker is available. It MUST pass before any change touching `project/noxfile.py.jinja`,
  `project/pyproject.toml.jinja`, or any pipeline template.
- After a change that alters rendered output, run `make regen-fixtures`, then confirm
  `git diff tests/expected/` shows movement only where it was intended. Movement elsewhere means the
  change disturbed a combination it should not have, which is a defect rather than something to
  regenerate away.
- Adding a project layout is confined to `copier.yml`, the conditional templates under `project/`, and
  the layout entry in `scripts/regen_fixtures.py`. The golden suite picks up the new fixtures without a
  per-fixture case, and the integration suite gains a case that generates the layout and runs it.
- `make release` is the only supported release path, and MUST be run from `main` so every release tag is
  reachable from the default branch. Version bumps are derived by `git-changelog --bump=auto` from
  commit types. A change that alters the shape of a generated project such that `copier update` would
  conflict against a customized file SHOULD be called out at release time so the bump can be
  reconsidered.
- Pre-commit runs on every commit and its hooks are not bypassed. It enforces trailing whitespace, end
  of file, YAML validity, and the conventional commit convention.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes ad hoc practice in this repository. Where a principle and a convenience
conflict, the principle wins or the principle is amended. It is not quietly ignored.

- **Amendment procedure**: amendments are made by editing this file in a commit that states the
  rationale, propagating the change to any affected template or guidance file in the same commit.
- **Versioning policy**: this document is versioned semantically. MAJOR for removing or redefining a
  principle in a backward-incompatible way or a structural rewrite, MINOR for adding a principle or
  materially expanding guidance, PATCH for clarification and wording.
- **Compliance review**: every change is reviewed against Principles I-VI and the Code Conventions. A
  reviewer MUST be able to see, from the diff and the commit message alone, that fixtures were
  regenerated by rendering, that every affected branch of the matrix was addressed, and that behavioural
  claims were established by execution.
- **Justified exceptions**: an exception MUST be recorded in the commit body with its reason and scope.
  An undocumented exception is a defect.

## Project Profile: copier-modern-python

This section instantiates the body above for this repository.

- Product: a Copier template. Its `project/` tree holds the `.jinja` sources that render into a new
  project, and `tests/expected/` holds the rendered output for every covered answer combination.
- Language: the repository's own Python is the scripts under `scripts/`, run on Python 3.11 or newer.
- Toolchain: `make` drives the tasks, `copier` renders, `bats` runs the golden and integration suites,
  `git-changelog` derives the changelog and version, and `pre-commit` enforces trailing whitespace, end
  of file, YAML validity, and the conventional commit convention.
- Generated projects: they target Python `>=3.11, <3.14`, use PDM or uv, and carry the quality floor of
  `ruff`, `mypy`, `bandit`, `pip-audit`, `deptry`, `pydoclint`, and `interrogate`. The template also
  offers an AGENTS.md and a Spec Kit constitution for AI coding agents, and seeds the latter from this
  same engineering body.
